    "- Work on some of the practice problems before starting on the homework.\n",
    "- Attempt the homework problems by yourself with the text, section work, and practice materials all at hand. Sometimes the week's lab will help as well. The two steps above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",
    "- At this point, seek help if you need it. Don't ask how to do the problem â€” ask how to get started, or for a nudge to get you past where you are stuck. Always say what you have already tried. That helps us help you more effectively.\n",

But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**b)** For $n \\ge 1$, let $C_n$ be the number of *switches* up to time $n$. That is, $C_n$ is the number of times the chain changes state up to and including time $n$. For example, if the path is $0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1$, then $C_8 = 3$ (remember that the path starts at $X_0$). What is the distribution of $C_n$, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** In the path $010100$, $X_0 = 0$ and $X_5 = 0$, so there is a $0 \\to 0$ transition in 5 steps. Find the value of $C_5$ for this path; you don't have to turn it in. For your own understanding, create several more examples of $0 \\to 0$ transitions for different values of $n$, and find the value of $C_n$ in each of your examples. There are already some more examples in the given path $010100$. For example the initial segment $010$ is a $0 \\to 0$ transition in 2 steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "**e)** Use Part **d** **(NOT THE BALANCE EQUATIONS)** to find the stationary distribution of the chain. This will give you a complete proof of the stationary distribution in this case, whereas our general discussion of the balance equations relies on your acceptance of the main [convergence theorem](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_10/03_Long_Run_Behavior.html#convergence-to-stationarity) without proof."
