    "\n",
    "Many assignments throughout the course will have a written portion and a code portion. Please follow the directions below to properly submit both portions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Written Portion ###\n",
    "*  Scan all the pages into a PDF. You can use any scanner or a phone using applications such as CamScanner. Please **DO NOT** simply take pictures using your phone. \n",
    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image in CamScanner or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",
    "* It is your responsibility to check that all the work on all the scanned pages is legible.\n",
    "* If you used $\\LaTeX$ to do the written portions, you do not need to do any scanning; you can just download the whole notebook as a PDF via LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Portion ###\n",
    "* Save your notebook using `File > Save and Checkpoint`.\n",
    "* Generate a PDF file using `File > Download As > PDF via LaTeX`. This might take a few seconds and will automatically download a PDF version of this notebook.\n",
    "    * If you have issues, please post a follow-up on the general Homework 8 Ed thread.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting ###\n",
    "* Combine the PDFs from the written and code portions into one PDF. [Here](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) is a useful tool for doing so. \n",
    "* Submit the assignment to Homework 8 on Gradescope. \n",
    "* **Make sure to assign each page of your pdf to the correct question.**\n",
    "* **It is your responsibility to verify that all of your work shows up in your final PDF submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having difficulties scanning, uploading, or submitting your work, please read the [Ed Thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/74394/discussion/6005296) on this topic and post a follow-up on the general Homework 8 Ed thread.\n",
