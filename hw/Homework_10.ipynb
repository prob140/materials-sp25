    "- Go to lecture and sections, and also go over the relevant text sections before starting on the homework. This will remind you what was covered in class, and the text will typically contain examples not covered in lecture. The weekly Study Guide will list what you should read.\n",
    "- Work on some of the practice problems before starting on the homework.\n",
    "- Attempt the homework problems by yourself with the text, section work, and practice materials all at hand. Sometimes the week's lab will help as well. The two steps above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",
    "- At this point, seek help if you need it. Don't ask how to do the problem â€” ask how to get started, or for a nudge to get you past where you are stuck. Always say what you have already tried. That helps us help you more effectively.\n",
    "- For a good measure of your understanding, keep track of the fraction of the homework you can do by yourself or with minimal help. It's a better measure than your homework score, and only you can measure it."

For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ or `sum([(1/3)*0.8, (2/3)*0.7])`is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n",
    "- You may consult others (see \"How to Do Your Homework\" above) but you must write up your own answers using your own words, notation, and sequence of steps.\n",
